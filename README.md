Registration Flow

Form validates inputs on the client side

Registration data is saved locally in the browser

User is redirected to WhatsApp with a pre-filled confirmation message

Admin Flow

Admin accesses the dashboard via a secure prompt

Stored registrations are rendered in a table

Data remains persistent across sessions (per browser)
